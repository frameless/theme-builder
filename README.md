# Theme builder

## Getting started

### Install prerequisites

You need to have the following tools installed to run the theme builder locally:

- Git
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- `pnpm`, `npm install -g pnpm`

### Running theme builder

First, make sure you have built the project:

```zsh
pnpm build
```

Next, run the project with Vite:

```zsh
pnpm vite
```

You should now be able to see the theme builder on your localhost.

Open the app on another tab and navigate to `/template/{template-name}/index` to see the template pages with live changes while you use the theme builder.
